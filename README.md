# Political-Tweet-Classifier
This is a classifier to predict political party affiliation from raw tweets using NLP techniques. I preprocessed text data with NLTK (tokenization, lemmatization) and extracted features using Scikit-learn. Then, I rained a Logistic Regression model, achieving 83% accuracy in classification.
